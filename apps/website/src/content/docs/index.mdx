Fabrik is a complete Flutter toolkit designed to help you build scalable and maintainable apps with ease.

It combines a powerful CLI and a growing set of packages — built for developers who care about clean architecture, productivity, and consistency.

## What does Fabrik Offer?

### Fabrik CLI

Scaffold complete, ready-to-use features with clean architecture (DDD-inspired)
No boilerplate — just run

```bash
fabrik generate feature user_profile
```

### Fabrik Snackbar (package)

A powerful, customizable snackbar & toast solution
Themes, variants, icons, durations — easily configurable

## Why Fabrik?

We built Fabrik because we were tired of copy-pasting the same architecture setup over and over.  
We also wanted to simplify the process of choosing and integrating common essentials like snackbars, toasts, and calendars — things that almost every app needs, but often require evaluating multiple options or custom setups.

**Our goals:**

- Provide a clean, reusable system for feature generation
- Bake in best practices for DDD, modularity, testability
- Make codebases more maintainable for teams and solo devs
- Offer commonly needed components like snackbars, toasts, calendars, and more — all under one reliable toolkit

Fabrik is more than just a CLI — it's a philosophy of building Flutter projects that scale.
