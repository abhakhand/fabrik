The Fabrik CLI is a powerful command-line tool that helps you quickly scaffold scalable, DDD-inspired features in your
Flutter apps — without boilerplate or setup fatigue.

Whether you're building a single-screen prototype or a full-scale production app, Fabrik CLI saves you time,
keeps your architecture clean, and helps your team stay consistent.

## What Can You Do with Fabrik CLI?

- Generate complete features using a clean architecture
- Create folders like models, entities, data_source, repository, usecases, and bloc with just one command
- Use reusable bricks (powered by Mason) to scaffold other useful components
- Keep your codebase consistent and scalable as your app grows

## Why a CLI?

We believe great developer experience starts with reducing repetitive work.
Fabrik CLI turns hours of setup into seconds — so you can focus on solving problems, not setting up boilerplate.
