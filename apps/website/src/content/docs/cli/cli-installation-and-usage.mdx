title: Installation & Usage
---

Installing the Fabrik CLI is fast and straightforward — all you need is Dart installed on your system.

## Installation

You can install the CLI globally using the following command:

```bash
dart pub global activate fabrik
```

Once installed, you can verify it works by running:

```bash
fabrik --help
```

You should see a list of available commands like generate, and their supported options.

## Usage

To scaffold a new feature using the Fabrik CLI, run:

```bash
fabrik generate feature user_profile
```

This will create a new user_profile folder with the full DDD-inspired architecture, like this:

```bash
./user_profile/
  |- blocs/
    |- user_profile_bloc.dart
    |- user_profile_event.dart
    |- user_profile_state.dart
  |- entities/
    |- user_profile.dart
  |- models/
    |- user_profile_model.dart
  |- usecases/
    |- get_user_profile_usecase.dart
  |- user_profile_repository.dart
  |- user_profile_data_source.dart
  |- user_profile.dart (barrel)
```

You can run this command multiple times for different features. Each feature is self-contained and follows the same clean structure.

Tip: Use hyphenated feature names (like user-profile) if needed — Fabrik will automatically convert them to snake_case and PascalCase where required.

You're now ready to start building features that scale with confidence.
