- Ensured it gets published and recognized by `pub.dev`.

## [0.1.3] - 2025-04-15

- Ensured `bricks/feature` is included in the published package using the `include:` key in `pubspec.yaml`.
- Fixed issue where the CLI couldnâ€™t find the brick (`Feature brick not found at bricks/feature`) when installed globally from pub.dev.
